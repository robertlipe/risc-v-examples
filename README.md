# risc-v-examples
RISC-V examples for GD32V, K210, and QEMU

This is a growing collection of how to do "simple" things for a variety of the RISC-V microcontrollers, such
as popularized by SiFive, Gigadevice GD32V, and Kendryte K210.

Short-term goals:
Show a minimal boot for each environment.
Show minimal blinking lights, when we have them.
Show minimal interrupt handling from an onboard timer.
Show words (maybe pictures) on the available screens.
